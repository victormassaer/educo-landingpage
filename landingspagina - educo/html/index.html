            <h2>What is Edcuo?</h2>
            <p>
                We focus ourselves in ‘live long learning’, but what exactly is that?
                For now, we go to school once and then we go to work.
                We are convinced that is not the way to go: to live, is to learn.
                <br><br>
                Our lives should be focused on gaining experience, learning new things every day,
                getting to know things you never heard about,
                to make your personal profile as strong as it has ever been.
                The job market is moving faster than ever: digitalization, job-hopping, circular economy, …
                makes that you must move forward to not fall behind. Standing still is going backwards.
                <br><br>
                We, at Educo, are combining that with the working life.
                We are focusing on combining the urge to learn with the need to work.

                <p>
                    You learn something by earning the “skill”.
                    That’s why we are going to map out what your skills are and where you can improve.
                    This competence matrix is based on the sector you work in, the company you are working,
                    even the job you currently performing. Based on this we make a profile of your skills
                    and make some recommendations and tips for you to start learning!

                    Keeping track of your staffs development has never been so easy.
                    Stay up to date with the learning process of your employees,
                    which courses they are following and the progress they have made so far.
                    This system makes sure everyone is aquiring the right skills for their function
                    while still being free to learn subjects based on their own interstest as well.
